App to keep all media files together

This app will scan complete file system and collect information about all files.
Then files are sorted according to their extensions in to Videos, Audio, Documents etc. lists which will make files more accessible according to type.

User can add custom playlists to keep certain media together.

While closing application all collected data is written in a file using XML format so that user can see same files in same playlists.
